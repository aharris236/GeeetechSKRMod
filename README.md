# Geeetech A10 Modification for Big Tree Tech SKR 1.4 Turbo / SKR 3 Control Board

## Purpose

This project is here for anybody attempting similar modifications to this type of 3D printer (Ender 3 Clone). I do not consider the work I have done on mine as being finished, and this is primarily for background information on what I've discovered during this. Some of this might not match with what others need, and some of it might just highlight things that could have been done in a better fashion.

The work I have done is not intended as an upgrade kit. It is messy, and has some elements that were parts of my testing and learning process. Not all parts of this may be relevant or as functional as you might want. Please keep this in mind when looking through this.

## Sections

The [3D Parts](/3D_Parts/) folder contains OpenSCAD models of things that I have printed while trying to improve this printer.

The [Notes](/Notes/) folder contains images and notes on what I attempted with the modifications.

## Safety

  - This type of printer is designed to generate heat. Be extremely careful when checking configurations with the printer active, or shortly after using it. **This can hurt you, and could potentially start a fire**.
  - This 3D printer runs from mains power through a power supply. I do not advise doing anything inside the power supply. **This can kill you, or start a fire**.
  - The power supply provides 24V DC power, and can provide a significant current output. Use suitable wire, noting expected current loads, and check the wires for damages and that connections are correct. **Risks of fire or electrocution**.
  - The electronics on the boards are sensitive devices, and static discharges or incorrect connections may damage them. **Risks of destroying expensive electronics**.
  - Some of the wiring on these printers can be thin and easy to break. Wire breaks can be extremely annoying to diagnose or locate.
  - Parts that are 3D printed and near the hotend or heatsinks could be warped or melted by the heat generated. This can be extremely annoying to clean up.

## Source material

The design for the box underneath the printer is a modification of the box designed by Michael Laws (Teaching Tech). A video regarding this is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k83M5H796U8) and the design can be found on Thingiverse [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3688967).
